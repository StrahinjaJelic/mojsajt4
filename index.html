It is a&nbsp;<a title="Rock opera" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_opera">rock opera</a>&nbsp;about Pink, a jaded rock star who constructs a 'wall' of social isolation.

							<p><em>The Wall</em>&nbsp;was recorded in several locations. In France, Super Bear Studios was used between January and July 1979, and Waters recorded his vocals at the nearby&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Miraval" title="Studio Miraval">Studio Miraval</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kamen" title="Michael Kamen">Michael Kamen</a>&nbsp;supervised the orchestral arrangements at&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_30th_Street_Studio" title="CBS 30th Street Studio">CBS Studios</a>&nbsp;in New York, in September.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall#cite_note-35">[34]</a></sup>&nbsp;Over the next two months the band used&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee_Studios" title="Cherokee Studios">Cherokee Studios</a>, Producers Workshop and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Village_(studio)" title="The Village (studio)">The Village Recorder</a>&nbsp;in Los Angeles. A plan to work with the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_Boys" title="Beach Boys">Beach Boys</a>&nbsp;at the Sundance Productions studio in Los Angeles was cancelled (although Beach Boys member&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Johnston" title="Bruce Johnston">Bruce Johnston</a>&nbsp;does sing backing vocals on &quot;In the Flesh?&quot;, &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;, the side 4 version of &quot;In the Flesh&quot;, and &quot;Waiting for the Worms&quot;) .<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall#cite_note-36">[35]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall#cite_note-37">[36]</a></sup></p>

Relations within the band were at a low ebb, and Ezrin became an intermediary between Waters and the rest of the band.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall#cite_note-Blakep263-41">[40]</a></sup></p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ezrin&#39;s poor punctuality caused problems with the tight schedule dictated by Waters.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall#cite_note-Blakep264-45">[44]</a></sup>&nbsp;Mason found Ezrin&#39;s behaviour &quot;erratic&quot;, but used his elaborate and unlikely excuses for his lateness as ammunition for &quot;tongue-in-cheek resentment&quot;.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall#cite_note-Masonpp243244-44">[43]</a></sup>&nbsp;Ezrin&#39;s share of the royalties was less than the rest of the band and he viewed Waters as a bully, especially when Waters mocked him by having badges made that read NOPE (No Points Ezrin), alluding to his lesser share.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall#cite_note-Blakep264-45">[44]</a></sup>&nbsp;Ezrin later said he had had marital problems and was not &quot;in the best shape emotionally&quot;.</p>
							<p>More problems became apparent when Waters&#39;s relationship with Wright broke down. The band were rarely in the studio together. Ezrin and Guthrie spliced Mason&#39;s previously recorded drum tracks together, and Guthrie worked with Waters and Gilmour during the day, returning at night to record Wright&#39;s contributions. Wright, worried about the effect that the introduction of Ezrin would have on band relationships, was keen to have a producer&#39;s credit on the album; their albums since&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_(Pink_Floyd_album)" title="More (Pink Floyd album)">More</a></em>&nbsp;(1969) had credited production to &quot;Pink Floyd&quot;.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall#cite_note-46">[45]</a></sup>&nbsp;Waters agreed to a trial period with Wright producing, after which he was to be given a producer&#39;s credit, but after a few weeks he and Ezrin expressed dissatisfaction with Wright&#39;s methods. A confrontation with Ezrin led to Wright working only at nights. Gilmour also expressed his annoyance, complaining that Wright&#39;s lack of input was &quot;driving us all mad&quot;.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall#cite_note-Blakep266-47">[46]</a></sup>&nbsp;Ezrin later reflected: &quot;it sometimes felt that Roger was setting him up to fail. Rick gets performance anxiety. You have to leave him alone to freeform, to create&nbsp;...&quot;<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall#cite_note-Blakep266-47">[46]</a></sup></p>

							<p>Wright was troubled by a failing marriage and the onset of depression, exacerbated by his non-residency. While the other band members brought their children, Wright&#39;s children were older and could not join as they were attending school; he said he missed them &quot;terribly&quot;.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall#cite_note-Blakep2672-48">[47]</a></sup>&nbsp;The band&#39;s holidays were booked for August, after which they were to reconvene at Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles, but&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Records" title="Columbia Records">Columbia</a>&nbsp;offered the band a better deal in exchange for a Christmas release of the album. Waters increased the band&#39;s workload accordingly, booking time at the nearby Studio Miraval.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall#cite_note-Masonp245-49">[48]</a></sup>&nbsp;He also suggested recording in Los Angeles ten days earlier than agreed, and hiring another keyboardist to work alongside Wright, whose keyboard parts had not yet been recorded. Wright, however, refused to cut short his family holiday in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes" title="Rhodes">Rhodes</a>.</p>

							<p>Accounts of Wright&#39;s subsequent departure from the band differ. In his autobiography,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Out:_A_Personal_History_of_Pink_Floyd" title="Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd">Inside Out</a></em>, Mason says that Waters called the band&#39;s manager,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_O%27Rourke" title="Steve O'Rourke">Steve O&#39;Rourke</a>, who was travelling to the US on the&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QE2" title="QE2">QE2</a></em>, and told him to have Wright out of the band by the time Waters arrived in LA to mix the album.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall#cite_note-51">[50]</a></sup>&nbsp;In another version recorded by a later historian of the band, Waters called O&#39;Rourke and asked him to tell Wright about the new recording arrangements, to which Wright responded: &quot;Tell Roger to fuck off&quot;.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall#cite_note-Blakep267-52">[51]</a></sup>&nbsp;Wright denied this, stating that the band had agreed to record only through the spring and early summer, and that he had no idea they were so far behind schedule. Mason later wrote that Waters was &quot;stunned and furious&quot;,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall#cite_note-Masonp245-49">[48]</a></sup>&nbsp;and felt that Wright was not doing enough.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall#cite_note-Masonp245-49">[48]</a></sup>&nbsp;Gilmour was on holiday in Dublin when he learnt of Waters&#39;s ultimatum, and tried to calm the situation. He later spoke with Wright and gave him his support, but reminded him about his minimal contributions.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall#cite_note-53">[52]</a></sup>&nbsp;Waters, however, insisted that Wright leave, or he would refuse to release&nbsp;<em>The Wall</em>. Several days later, worried about their financial situation and the failing interpersonal relationships within the band, Wright quit. News of his departure was kept from the music press.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall#cite_note-54">[53]</a></sup>&nbsp;Although his name did not appear on some editions of the album (it does appear on the UK gatefold sleeve),<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall#cite_note-55">[54]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall#cite_note-Blakep269-56">[55]</a></sup>&nbsp;he was employed as a session musician on the band&#39;s subsequent tour.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall#cite_note-Blake285286-57">[56]</a></sup></p>

							<p>By August 1979, the running order was largely complete. Wright completed his duties at Cherokee Studios aided by session musicians Peter Wood and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Mandel" title="Fred Mandel">Fred Mandel</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Porcaro" title="Jeff Porcaro">Jeff Porcaro</a>&nbsp;played drums in Mason&#39;s stead on &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_(Pink_Floyd_song)" title="Mother (Pink Floyd song)">Mother</a>&quot;.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall#cite_note-Blakep269-56">[55]</a></sup>&nbsp;Mason left the final mix to Waters, Gilmour, Ezrin and Guthrie, and travelled to New York to record his debut solo album,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Mason%27s_Fictitious_Sports" title="Nick Mason's Fictitious Sports">Nick Mason&#39;s Fictitious Sports</a></em>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall#cite_note-Masonp249-58">[57]</a></sup>&nbsp;In advance of its release, technical constraints led to some changes to the running order and content of&nbsp;<em>The Wall</em>, with &quot;What Shall We Do Now?&quot; replaced by the similar but shorter &quot;Empty Spaces&quot;, and &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey_You_(Pink_Floyd_song)" title="Hey You (Pink Floyd song)">Hey You</a>&quot; being moved from the end of side three to the beginning. With the November 1979 deadline approaching, the band left the inner sleeves of the album unchanged.</p>
